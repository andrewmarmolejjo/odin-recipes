        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> <strong>hard-boiled eggs</strong> that have been shelled, cut in half, and filled with a paste made from the egg yolks mixed with other ingredients such as mayonnaise and mustard. They are generally served cold as a side dish, appetizer or a main course during gatherings or parties. The dish's origin can be seen in recipes for boiled, seasoned eggs as far back as ancient Rome, where they were traditionally served as a first course. The dish is popular in Europe and North America.</p>

Serving eggs while entertaining guests was so common for wealthy Romans, they even had a saying for it, “ab ova usque ad mala”, meaning “from eggs to apples”, or from the beginning of a meal to the end.</p>
